# Car-Number-Plate-Detection
Basic python program using opencv to detect number plates

This project is made using python and opencv . 
I haven't used anything machine learning or rendering stuff to detect number plate . 
It is based on contour in opencv . It dosent give you numbers directly it's just highlights (gives you the coordinate ) the rectangular area of number plate in image
